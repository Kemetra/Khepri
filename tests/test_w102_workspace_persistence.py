"""`W1-02`: the workspace tables and their store (`RCA-005` `FR-109`--`FR-113`).

`W1-01` wrote the domain contracts and deliberately held no persistence. This module asserts what
the schema is, which is a different property from what the dataclass is: a column can be added to a
table without touching a record, and `test_w101_workspace_contracts.py`'s field-set equalities would
stay green through it. So every structural assertion here reads the **emitted schema** through
`inspect(...)` rather than the model's fields.

`FR-113` -- one Alembic head -- is asserted where it already lives, in
`test_rca001_session_persistence.py`, whose pinned revision this slice updates rather than
duplicates. A second head test would be a second place to forget.
